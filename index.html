    Computing and the Threat to Security Technology</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-quantum-computing">What is Quantum Computing?</h2>
<h3 id="overview-of-quantum-computers">Overview of Quantum
    Computers</h3>
<p>Quantum computing (or quantum computers) is a new model of
    computation that utilizes techniques and theories from quantum
    mechanics. One of the most significant differences is the efficiency of
    computation. Due to the unique characteristics of quantum computation,
    certain algorithms or problems that are intractable for classical
    computers can be solved efficiently with quantum computing.</p>
<p>There are many potential applications of quantum computing. One
    example is cryptanalysis, which relies heavily on mathematical theory
    and the complexity of algorithms. Another application is in machine
    learning, where training and optimizing large datasets require massive
    amounts of computation.</p>
<h3
        id="difference-between-classical-computers-and-quantum-computers">Difference
    Between Classical Computers and Quantum Computers</h3>
<p>One of the most significant differences between classical and quantum
    computers is the concept of the qubit. While classical computers use
    binary bits (0 or 1), qubits can exist in superposition of states. A
    qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information and can be
    represented as: <span
            class="math display"><em>a</em>|0⟩ + <em>b</em>|1⟩</span> where a and
    b are the probability amplitudes of
    the qubit being in the 0 or 1 state, respectively. These amplitudes must
    satisfy: <span
            class="math display">|<em>a</em>|<sup>2</sup> + |<em>b</em>|<sup>2</sup> = 1.</span></p>
<p>Another key characteristic of quantum computers is the use of quantum
    circuits. Quantum circuits manipulate qubits through quantum logic
    gates, which are analogs of classical logic gates. Unlike classical
    logic gates, which use Boolean algebra, quantum logic gates operate
    using linear algebra due to the superposition and entanglement of qubit
    states.</p>
<p>The input to a quantum circuit is generally a set of qubits
    initialized to the 0 state. Quantum gates, such as the Hadamard gate
    (H), can put qubits into superposition, and measurement collapses the
    qubit state to either 0 or 1.</p>
<h3 id="quantum-algorithms">Quantum Algorithms</h3>
<p>Quantum algorithms are a new type of algorithm based on the
    principles of quantum computation. Due to the unique computational
    abilities of quantum computers, some quantum algorithms have polynomial
    time complexity, allowing them to solve problems that classical
    computers cannot solve efficiently.</p>
<p>One example is Shor’s algorithm, developed by Peter Shor in 1994.
    Shor’s algorithm is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization. It
    can factorize large numbers efficiently using quantum computation,
    posing a significant threat to cryptographic systems like RSA, which
    rely on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers for
    security.</p>
<p>Another example is Grover’s algorithm, developed by Lov Grover in
    1996. Grover’s algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that can search
    unsorted databases faster than classical algorithms. While classical
    algorithms require linear time complexity for searching unsorted data,
    Grover’s algorithm achieves a time complexity of <span
            class="math inline">O(&radic; n)</span>, which is
    quadratically faster.</p>
<p>This algorithm can accelerate cyberattacks based on exhaustive search
    methods. For example, a brute-force attack on AES-128 encryption would
    require <span class="math inline">2<sup>126</sup></span> operations
    classically, but only <span class="math inline">2<sup>63</sup></span>
    operations using Grover’s algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="threats-to-security-technology">Threats to Security
    Technology</h2>
<h3 id="overview-of-cryptography">Overview of Cryptography</h3>
<p>Cryptography is the practice of securing information or establishing
    secure communications through encryption. Its origin date back to
    ancient Egypt, around 3000 years ago. Today cryptography is widely used
    in many technologies and systems, such as passwords, electronic
    signatures, and authentication.</p>
<h3 id="symmetric-and-asymmetric-encryption">Symmetric and Asymmetric
    Encryption</h3>
<p>There are many types of encryption technics, but generally, they can
    be categorized into two groups: symmetric and asymmetric
    Encryption.</p>
<p>Symmetric encryption uses shared key for both encryption and
    decryption. The security relies on the secrecy of the key and the
    strength of the encryption algolithm.</p>
<p>Asymmetric encryption, such as RSA-cryptosystem, uses different keys
    for encryption and decryption. The key for encryption is public, and the
    receiver uses a private key to decrypt the text.</p>
<h3 id="threats-from-quantum-computing">Threats from Quantum
    Computing</h3>
<p>Quantum computer and its technology pose a significant threat to
    current cryptographic systems.</p>
<p>One of the examples is an RSA encryption algorithm. Nowadays, an RSA
    encryption system is considered as a secure encryption system, because
    decryption of the encrypted text without a secret key takes exponential
    time.<br/>
    But quantum algorithms for factoring such as Shor’s algorithm can brake
    RSA encryption, because it can factorize large natural
    numbers efficiently.</p>
<h3 id="mitigation-measures">Mitigation Measures</h3>
<p>Today the study of the cryptography in quantum computer era is
    ongoing.</p>
<p>Post-quantum cryptography involves developing new cryptographic
    algorithms that are resistant to attacks by quantum computers. Examples
    include lattice-based cryptography, multivariate cryptography,
    hash-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, and isogeny-based
    cryptography.</p>
<p>Cryptography with the theory of quantum computing is also a great
    interest of current cryptography. Quantum cryptography uses the
    principles of quantum mechanics to secure communication. For example,
    quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two parties to generate a shared
    secret key with security guaranteed by the laws of quantum physics.
    Another example is Quantum random number generation, which provides
    truly random numbers, unlike pseudo random numbers from classical
    computation theory.</p>
